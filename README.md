## *Description*
The project of online thrift shop is trying to build a website for a local community, like people in a same city, or students in a college or university, to sell the items they don't like anymore but reusable for others. 

The website lets people sign up as a customer of APP to sell their old items and buy the other's items. The sign-in customers are able to post the selling items and also search their available items to mark the items they want. Then they can finish the shop transaction locally by commucating through the phone or email.  

The application will be implemented with a Vue frontend, a Python/Django backend, and Postgres database.
